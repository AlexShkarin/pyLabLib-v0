General concepts
----------------

Most devices share common methods and approach to make them more predictable and easier to use.

First, the device identifier / address needs to be provided by user during the device object creation, and it is automatically connected. The devices have ``open`` and ``close`` methods but the device also works as a resource (with Python ``with`` statement), so these usually aren't used explicitly.

The devices usually have ``get_settings`` and ``apply_settings`` methods which return Python dictionaries with the most common settings or take these dictionaries and apply them.
In addition, there are ``get_full_status`` and ``get_full_info`` functions, which return progressively more information (``get_full_status`` adds variable status information which cannot be changed by user, and ``get_full_info`` adds constant device information, such as model name and serial number).
``get_full_info`` can be particularly useful to check the device status and see if it is connected and working properly.

Devices of the same kind (e.g., cameras or translation stages) aim to have consistent overlapping interfaces (where it makes sense), so different devices are fairly interchangeable in simple applications.

Examples
--------

Connecting to a Cryomagnetics LM500 level meter and reading out the level at the first channel::

    from pylablib.aux_libs.devices import Cryomagnetics  # import the device library
    # Next, create the device object and connect to the device;
    #   the connection is automatically opened on creation, and closed when the ``with`` block is ended
    with Cryomagnetics.LM500("COM1") as lm:
        level = lm.get_level(1)  # read the level

Stepping the M Squared laser wavelength and recording an image from the Andor IXON camera at each step::

    from pylablib.aux_libs.devices import M2, Andor  # import the device libraries
    with M2.M2ICE("192.168.0.1", 39933) as laser, Andor.AndorCamera() as cam:  # connect to the devices
        # change some camera parameters
        cam.set_shutter("open")
        cam.set_exposure(50E-3)
        cam.set_amp_mode(preamp=2)
        cam.set_EMCCD_gain(128)
        cam.setup_image_mode(vbin=2, hbin=2)
        # setup acquisition mode
        cam.set_acquisition_mode("cont")
        cam.setup_cont_mode()
        # start camera acquisition
        cam.start_acquisition()
        wavelength = 740E-9  # initial wavelength (in meters)
        images = []
        while wavelength < 770E-9:
            laser.tune_wavelength_table(wavelength)  # tune the laser frequency (using coarse tuning)
            time.sleep(0.5)  # wait until the laser stabilizes
            cam.wait_for_frame()  # ensure that there's a frame in the camera queue
            frame = cam.read_newest_image()
            images.append(frame)
            wavelength += 0.5E-9

------------------------
Additional requirements
------------------------

First, any device using ``PyVISA`` require NI VISA to be installed. See `PyVISA <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ for details.

Second, some devices need dlls supplied by the manufacturer:

    - Andor SDK2 cameras: require `atmcd.dll` (currently supplied for x64 and x86). Can be obtained with Andor Solis software, or Andor SDK. If Andor Solis is installed in the default location (`C:/Program Files/Andor Solis`), these dlls are accessed automatically. It might be called `atmcd64d_legacy.dll` or `atmcd32d_legacy.dll` (depending on the Solis version and Python bitness), but it needs to be renamed to `atmcd.dll` when placed into `aux_libs/devices/libs/x64` (or `x32`) folder.
    - Andor SDK3 cameras: require several `at*.dll`: `atcore.dll`, `atblkbx.dll`, `atcl_bitflow.dll`, `atdevapogee.dll`, `atdevregcam.dll`, `atusb_libusb.dll`, `atusb_libusb10.dll` (currently supplied only for x64). Has potential incompatibilities between different versions of Windows; tested with Windows 7 x64 and Andor Solis 4.30.30034.0. Can be obtained with Andor Solis software. If Andor Solis is installed in the default location (`C:/Program Files/Andor Solis`), these dlls are accessed automatically.
    - PCO SC2 cameras: require several `SC2_*.dll`: `SC2_Cam.dll`, `sc2_cl_me4.dll`, `sc2_cl_mtx.dll`, `sc2_cl_nat.dll`, `sc2_cl_ser.dll`, `sc2_clhs.dll`. These are provided with pco.sdk, which can be obtained on `PCO website <https://www.pco.de/software/development-tools/pcosdk/>`_.
    - Arcus PerforMax translation stages: require `PerformaxCom.dll` and `SiUSBXp.dll`. Can be obtained from `Arcus website <https://www.arcus-technology.com/support/downloads/download-category/sample-source-code/>`_, either at `USB 64-bit DLL <https://www.arcus-technology.com/support/downloads/download-info/usb-64-bit-dll/>`_ (for 64-bit systems), or inside `Python USB source <https://www.arcus-technology.com/support/downloads/download-info/python-usb-source/>`_ (for 32-bit systems)
    - HighFinesse WS/6 and WS/7 wavemeters: require `wlmData.dll`. Each device needs a unique dll supplied by the manufacturer. One can either supply DLL path on creation of the device class, or place it into `aux_libs/devices/libs/x64` (or `x32`) folder; in the latter case, it should be renamed to `wlmData6.dll` or `wlmData7.dll` depending on the wavemeter model (WS/6 or WS/7).
    - SmarAct SCU3D translation stage controller: requires `SCU3DControl.dll`. Should be supplied with the device by the manufacturer.

For the application to have access to them, they need to be placed into the package folder (correspondingly, into ``aux_libs/devices/libs/`` inside the main package folder, which is usually something like ``Python36/Lib/site-packages/pylablib/``).

Third, some devices need additional software installed:

    - IMAQ cameras: National Instruments IMAQ library.
    - IMAQdx cameras: National Instruments IMAQdx library.
    - Photon Focus cameras: Photon Focus PFRemote software.
    - Hamamatsu DCAM cameras: DCAM software (Hamamatsu HOKAWO) and drivers.
    - Andor cameras: Andro Solis software and drivers
    - NI DAQs: National Instruments NI-DAQmx library (with C support; just Runtime is sufficient).
    - HighFinesse: manufacturer-provided drivers and software (specific to the particular wavemeter).
    - Thorlabs Kinesis devices (KFF, KDC101, K10CR1): Kinesis/APT software.
    - Trinamic hardware: Trinamic TMCL-IDE (needed to install device drivers)
    - Arcus PerforMax software: Arcus Drivers and Tools, Arcus USB Series and Arcus Performax Series software (needed to install device drivers).
    - Zurich Instruments: manufacturer provided software and Python libraries.

The list might be incomplete, and it does not include drivers for all USB devices.
