Welcome to pyLabLib's documentation!
====================================

**This is the last 0.x version of the library. The new library (1.x) is located at** https://github.com/AlexShkarin/pyLabLib/, ** and its documentation can be found at** https://pylablib.readthedocs.io/. **It has large changes in the interface and code organization, rendering almost all previous code partially incompatible (see the** `new documentation <https://pylablib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#version-1-x/>`__ **for details).**
